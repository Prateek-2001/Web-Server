## Description

### What is a web server?

A web server is a piece of software that accepts HTTP requests (e.g. GET requests for HTML pages), and returns responses (e.g. HTML pages). Other common uses are GET requests for getting data from RESTful API endpoints, images within web pages, and POST requests to upload data to the server (e.g. a form submission or file upload).
